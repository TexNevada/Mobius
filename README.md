#### So what is Mobius exactly?

Mobius is a core framework recreation of my MODUS discord Bot.

Mobius is an off the shelf discord bot & framework that is designed to be a bot that is easy to develop for & to use!

- It's modular, meaning you can add your own commands & features with ease!
- It's easily configurable.
- 
 
This framework should be: 
- Ease of use. 
- ease of development. 
- ease of deployment. 
- ease of maintenance.

The plan:
- [x] Refactor old MODUS code to be generic.
- [x] Allow for heartbeat monitoring.
- [ ] Move MODUS code to it's separate repository.
- [ ] Create a proper logging system. _( Partially there )_
- [ ] Create a proper configuration system. _( Partially there )_
- [ ] Create example cog.
- [ ] Add support for custom git modules.
- [ ] Add the ability to reload cogs.
